# MultiBound 2: Electric Boogaloo
### Starbound Instance Launcher
MultiBound enables you to quickly and easily set up and use multiple separate instances (or profiles) of Starbound with their own mod list and save directory.

## How to use
(instructions pending; once you start it up it should be fairly self-explanatory, though)

## How to compile
Make sure you have:
- Up to date QtCreator
- libxml++ and dependencies
Open up the project and build like you would any other Qt application.
