# MultiBound 2 // Starbound Instance Launcher
MultiBound enables you to quickly and easily set up and use multiple separate instances (or profiles) of Starbound with their own mod list and save directory.

## Installing and running
- **Windows:** Unzip anywhere writable and double-click `multibound.exe`. *(builds coming eventually; I don't have a Windows machine)*
- **Arch Linux:** Install `multibound-git` from the AUR; "MultiBound 2" will be added to your launcher.
- **Other Linux/\*nix:** Clone from git and compile using QtCreator.

## How to use
(instructions pending; once you start it up it should be fairly self-explanatory, though!)

## How to compile
Make sure you have:
- Up to date QtCreator
- libxml++ and dependencies

Open up the project and build like you would any other Qt application.
